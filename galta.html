        <div id="rt"><p><bold>Galtaji is an ancient Hindu pilgrimage about 10 km away from Jaipur, in the Indian state of Rajasthan. The site consists of a series of temples built into a narrow crevice in the ring of hills that surrounds Jaipur. A natural spring emerges high on the hill and flows downward, filling a series of sacred kunds (water tanks) in which pilgrims bathe. Visitors and pilgrims can ascend the crevasse, continuing past the highest water pool to a hilltop temple from there are views of Jaipur and its fortifications spreads out across the valley floor. It is believed that a Saint named Galav lived here, practiced meditation, and did penance (tapasya).Built within a mountain pass in the Aravalli Hills 10 km. east of Jaipur,[2] Since the early 15th century Galtaji has been a retreat for Hindu ascetics belonging to the Vaishnava Ramanuja sect.[1] It is said to have been in the occupation of yogis for a long time; Payohari Krishnadas, a Ramanandi sadhu, i.e. a follower of the Ramanandi Sampradaya came to Galta in the early 15th century and, by his yogic powers, drove away other yogis from the place.[3] Galta was northern India's first Vaishnava Ramanuja Peeth and became the one of the most important centres of the Ramanuja sect. The temple features a number of pavilions with rounded roofs, carved pillars and painted walls. The complex is set around a natural spring and waterfalls that create 7 Holy Ponds.</bold></p></div></div>
