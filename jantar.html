        <div id="rt"><p><bold>Between 1724 and 1730 Maharajah Sawaii Jai Singh II of Jaipur constructed five astronomical observatories in northern India. The observatories, or "Jantar Mantars" as they are commonly known, incorporate multiple buildings of unique form, each with a specialized function for astronomical measurement. These structures with their striking combinations of geometric forms at large scale have captivated the attention of architects, artists, and art historians world wide, yet remain largely unknown to the general public. Explore the observatories by reading more about them in the Learn section, taking a virtual Tour, or visiting the Gallery.

            The Learn section, features a wealth of information about the observatories and the unique instruments Jai Singh created to observe celestial objects.
            But more than that, the Learn section also features projects you can do to learn more about the observatories and sky observation without a telescope.
            
            The Tours section features panoramic virtual tours that work on desktops, laptops, and mobile devices!
            
            And the Gallery presents curated collections of photographs, panoramas, 3D models, and animations in a portfolio format.</bold></p></div></div>
