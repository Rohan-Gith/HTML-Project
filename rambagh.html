        <div id="rt"><p><bold>The first building on the site was a garden house built in 1835 for the wet nurse of prince Ram Singh II.[1] In 1887, during the reign of Maharaja Thakur Sawai Madho Singh, it was converted into a modest royal hunting lodge, as the house was located in the midst of a thick forest at that time. In the early 20th century, it was expanded into a palace to the designs of Sir Samuel Swinton Jacob.[2] Maharajah Sawai Man Singh II made Rambagh his principal residence and added a number of royal suites in 1931.

            It is now operated as a five-star hotel by the Taj Hotels Group. Anderson Cooper stayed at the Rambagh Palace in 2009.</bold></p></div></div>
